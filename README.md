Educational 8 Bits Computer = building a complete computer for educational purposes, with software simulation.

This project is based on following books : Malvino's ASAP computer (Digital computer electronics 2nd ed) and The elements of computing systems ( Noam Nissan, Shimon Shockhen)

First step of the project is to build a microprocessor with Logisim.

Next steps will be to write in python : an assembler, compiler and elementary operating system.
Those will run on a simulator of the microprocessor, also written in python.
